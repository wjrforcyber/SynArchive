# SynArchive

This repo will archive some of the old synthesis tools.
The "build-from-source" is verified by me myself and will have a docker image provided. For those who are also requiring method of manually build/modify the source, just pull the archived image.

## Why this
Although ABC contains most of the SOTA method. Classic tools might still be useful as a reference for implementation of algorithms.
<br>Some of the really old tools such as SIS, lack of official maintainance since 2005. Take unofficial SIS 1.3 as an example, the build requires gcc 3.2.2 which is really old, modification is needed here to bring it back to life.

## Note
All the content in this README is **based on** every README in submodules I archive, it's important you read the original README and then this one.
<br>The content is organized as follows:
- The original docker image I use
- A lists of packages I have installed
- Some tricky points that need to be manually modified
- The result image I archived which for simply pull and build

## MVSIS

### Original Docker information:
- [origianl docker image of ubuntu 20.04](https://hub.docker.com/layers/library/ubuntu/20.04/images/sha256-e5a6aeef391a8a9bdaee3de6b28f393837c479d8217324a2340b64e45a81e0ef)

### TRICKY POINTS
#### List of packages
```
autoconf Version: 2.69-11.1
gcc-9-multilib Version: 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.2
libreadline-dev Version: 8.0-4
```
If you are interested in versions of other packages, check the docker image I created below.
<br>First of all, **DO FOLLOWING** what mentioned in MVSIS [here](https://github.com/wjrforcyber/mvsis). If you are using the same image as I use(ubuntu 20.04), you will probably failed on `gcc-multilib`.
<br> Based on the `gcc` version and hint given, install related packages, for me,
```
gcc --version
gcc (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.2) 9.4.0
Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO

```
Do the following **in order**:
```
apt-get install -y binutils:i386 cpp-9:i386 gcc-9-multilib
```

#### Configure
Since the original repo suggests compile on 32 bit first and compare with 64 bit version, you should make sure each one works as expected.
Now if you `configure`, you may see crash on unrecognized architecture like this:
```
checking build system type... Invalid configuration `aarch64-pc-linux-gnu': machine `aarch64-pc' not recognized
configure: error: /bin/bash helpers/config.sub aarch64-pc-linux-gnu failed
```
Modify line 152 in https://github.com/wjrforcyber/mvsis/blob/7e225952c1d32f63905bfd52a0b92dc1e3ab39e2/helpers/config.sub#L152

By reference [this issue](https://github.com/li3tuo4/rc-fpga-zcu/issues/6), add `aarch64-pc` to it, it will look like:
```
...
tahoe | i860 | m68k | m68000 | m88k | ns32k | aarch64-pc | arm \
...
```
Then `configure` will be good to go.

### Archived image
This image is generated by the container of the ubuntu official image after I finished the experiment.
Link [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/jingrenwang/mvsis/tags). Type
```
docker pull jingrenwang/mvsis:latest
```
to fetch.
